## Introduction

**Before diving into implementation, let's first understand the basic concepts.**


### The Meaning of Integrating AI into Applications

In traditional application development, programmers wrote logic one by one in code.<br>
However, by integrating AI, applications gain the ability to **learn, infer, and create**.

**For example:**
- 📸 **Traditional**: Just upload and display images
- ✨ **AI**: Understand image content and automatically tag and categorize

- 💬 **Traditional**: Just display frequently asked questions (FAQ)
- ✨ **AI**: Understand user questions and generate context-appropriate responses

- 🎨 **Traditional**: Just display and edit existing images
- ✨ **AI**: Create new images from text or other images

### Why AI Now?

#### 1. AI Has Become Accessible

Previously, using AI required advanced machine learning knowledge and powerful computers. But now:

- **Easy to use via API** - Add AI features with just a few lines of code
- **Generous free tiers** - Can be used for free for learning and small-scale projects
- **Japanese support** - Capable of questions and answers in Japanese

#### 2. Dramatically Improved User Experience

By integrating AI:

- **Personalization**: AI responds instead of predetermined logic, providing an experience optimized for each individual
- **Automation**: Automatically processes complex and tedious tasks
- **Intelligence**: Understands and behaves like a human


### What AI Can and Cannot Do

#### ✅ What AI Can Do

1. **Image Recognition & Understanding**
   - Identification of objects, people, places
   - Image content description
   - Quality checking

2. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Answering questions
   - Text summarization
   - Translation
   - Sentiment analysis

3. **Content Generation**
   - Text creation
   - Image generation
   - Music generation
   - Code generation

4. **Prediction & Recommendation**
   - Learning user preferences
   - Optimal suggestions
   - Anomaly detection

#### ❌ What AI Struggles With

1. **Tasks Requiring Perfect Accuracy**
   - AI sometimes makes mistakes (hallucination)
   - Important decisions should have final human verification

2. **Adapting to Real-time Changes**
   - Doesn't always have the latest information
   - Knowledge up to the point of training data

3. **Ethical Judgments**
   - Moral judgments
   - Cultural considerations
   - Privacy considerations

### Real-world Application Examples

#### Image & Video AI

- **Google Photos**: Automatically categorizes and searches by "dog", "cat", "food", etc. with AI image recognition
- **Adobe Firefly**: Generates images from text (built into Photoshop)
- **YouTube**: Automatic caption generation (speech recognition AI)

#### Text & Conversation AI

- **ChatGPT**: Conversational answers to questions, text creation
- **Gmail Smart Compose**: Automatically generates and completes email content
- **Notion AI**: Page summarization, text generation, translation

#### Voice AI

- **Google Assistant / Siri**: Voice operation and question answering
- **Spotify DJ**: AI selects and introduces music
- **Microsoft Copilot**: Operates Office apps with voice

#### Recommendation

- **YouTube**: Recommends next videos based on viewing history
- **Netflix**: Recommends shows and movies matching preferences
- **Amazon**: Suggests products based on purchase history


### Significance of What We're Learning Today

#### 1. Experience Using AI APIs

You don't need difficult specialized knowledge to use AI. By using existing AI APIs, you can add AI features with just web application development knowledge.

#### 2. Practical Skills

The three features we're implementing today are commonly used in actual applications:

- **Image Recognition**: Product search for EC sites, medical diagnosis support
- **Chatbot**: Customer support, educational apps
- **Image Generation**: Design tools, games, entertainment

### Important Considerations When Working with AI APIs

#### 1. Be Cost-Conscious

- APIs have usage limits and charges
- Know how to use within the free tier
- Monitor usage in production environments

#### 2. Privacy and Security

- Be careful when sending user personal information to AI APIs

#### 3. User Experience

- AI processing takes time (good to provide loading displays, etc.)
- Handle errors appropriately
- Present results in a form users can understand

## Troubleshooting

### Error Example 1: Database Connection Error

**Error Message**:
```
Error: P1013: The provided database string is invalid
```

**Cause**: DATABASE_URL format is incorrect

**Solution**:
1. Check DATABASE_URL in `.env` file
2. If password contains special characters, URL encoding (replacement) is needed:
   - `!` → `%21`
   - `@` → `%40`
   - `#` → `%23`

---

### Error Example 2: Image Upload Fails

**Error Message**:
```
Failed to upload file
```

**Cause**: Storage policy not set

**Solution**:
1. Supabase dashboard → Storage → pet-images → Policies
2. Check if "Allow authenticated users to upload" policy exists
3. If not, re-execute step 2-4

---

### Error Example 3: Cannot Login

**Cause**: Environment variable configuration error

**Solution**:
1. Check the following in `.env.local`:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
